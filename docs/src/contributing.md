## Changing the codebase

You should fork this project, make changes in your own fork, then submit a pull request.

To start working on this project:

* Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv)
* Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    # using HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/k-tech-italy/ktcalendars.git

    # using SSH
    git clone git@github.com:k-tech-italy/ktcalendars.git
    ```
* If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net/), copy the `.envrc.example` file as follows, otherwise skip this step:
    ```bash
    cp .envrc.example .envrc
    ```
* Create a virtual environment for the project using uv. Make sure you use the earliest supported Python version:
    ```bash
    uv venv create --python 3.10

    # if you're not using direnv, you need to manually activate the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
* Install the project's dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

**You must make sure that your changes are covered by unit and integration tests, and that it follows the project's stylistic guidelines.** In the absence of the latter, you should mimic the style and patterns in the existing codebase.

### Running tests

You should ensure that all tests are passing. We use `pytest` to write and run tests.
```bash
pytest tests
```

You should also make sure that your changes work with all supported versions of Python and Django. For that, we are using `tox`:
```bash
tox
```

### Formatting and linting

This project uses `ruff` to format and lint code.

Run the lints using `tox`:
```bash
tox -e lint
```

Format the code using `ruff`:
```bash
ruff check flags --fix
ruff format
```
